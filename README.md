Bar graph showing Bjergsen (TSM) vs Jensen (TL) in creep score per minute throughout their professional
gaming careers.

'Creep Score' or 'farming' is defined as dealing the killing blow on a minion or monster. This can also be
called 'last hitting', and it is often used to gauge how well a person plays a particular game of 
League of Legends. At the professional level, 10CS/min is considered an optimal creep score. This
means that for every minute that passes in game time, a player should have 10CS. So in a 30 minute game,
a 300 creep score would be considered perfect CS'ing.
